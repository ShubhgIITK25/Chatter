I created a demo of country dashboard showing only population and region main purpose is just to fetch data from API and show it on UI and i also used my old preoject UI and took some help from it 
in making a normal group discussion area. In UI i took help from online sources and AI 
I used Node JS (express, socket, HTTP etc) To run it locally just we need to bash node server.js as it uses node server
I also deployed this using Railway hosting URL for it https://chatter-production-a71c.up.railway.app/

(To get a better trial use chatting part in 2 seprate webpages)
Thank you
