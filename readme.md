I created a demo of country dashboard showing only population and region main purpose is just to fetch data from API and show it on UI and i also used my old preoject UI and took some help from it 
in making a normal group discussion area. In UI i took help from online sources and AI 
I used Node JS (express, socket, HTTP etc)
I also deployed this using Railway hosting URL for it https://chatter-production-a71c.up.railway.app/
